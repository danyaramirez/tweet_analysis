Among the three files needed for the project, one was provided by the instructor of the course, the second was downloaded programmatically with the request library, and the third was to be accessed from Twitter’s API.
For the third file, I was supposed to create a Twitter Developer’s Account and follow the instructions to obtain the data. I had not received any confirmation from Twitter by the time I needed to get the data, but anyway I used the code provided, and after a bit of struggle, I was able to get *some* data. However, it had too many ‘Fail’ files, so following a mentor’s advice, I downloaded the file directly from the course’s site.
